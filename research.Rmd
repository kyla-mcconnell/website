# Collocation measures, task effects & chunk frequency

The following summary is based on the paper [Effects of task and corpus-derived association scores on the online processing of collocations](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/cllt.ahead-of-print/cllt-2018-0030/cllt-2018-0030.xml). The paper and all research was done together with [Alice Blumenthal-Dram√©](https://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/mitarbeiter-und-sprechstunden/blumenthal). You can see the [poster version here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyla_Mcconnell2/publication/335991813_Can_corpus-derived_collocation_measures_reflect_expectations_in_language_processing/links/5d89d584458515cbd1be541c/Can-corpus-derived-collocation-measures-reflect-expectations-in-language-processing.pdf).
